this function takes 2 integers as an input:
one is the counter boundary for the loop
one is the forms_id

loop through the counter and insert a new event into the database
the event's date will be at increments of 1 year



CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION insert_events( n INTEGER, forms_id INTEGER )
	RETURNS VOID AS $$
	
	DECLARE
		counter INTEGER := 0 ;
	BEGIN
	LOOP
		EXIT WHEN counter = n;
		INSERT INTO events (forms_id, date) VALUES (forms_id, now() + counter * INTERVAL '1 year');
		counter := counter + 1;
	END LOOP;
END;
