this function does the same as insert_events_1, but it also takes the actual interval
as a parameter in which to insert the events


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION insert_events_2( in n INTEGER, in forms_id INTEGER, in intvl INTERVAL)
	RETURNS VOID AS $$
	
	DECLARE
		counter INTEGER := 0 ;
	BEGIN
	LOOP
		EXIT WHEN counter = n;
		INSERT INTO events (forms_id, date) VALUES (forms_id, now() + counter * intvl);
		counter := counter + 1;
	END LOOP;
END; 
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
