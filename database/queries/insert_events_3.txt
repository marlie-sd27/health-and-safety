this function does the same as insert_events_1, but it also takes the actual interval
as a parameter in which to insert the events


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION insert_events_3( in start DATE, in forms_id INTEGER, in intvl INTERVAL)
	RETURNS VOID AS $$
	
	DECLARE
		finish DATE := start + INTERVAL '5 years' ;
	BEGIN
	LOOP
		EXIT WHEN start = finish;
		INSERT INTO events (forms_id, date) VALUES (forms_id, start);
		start := start + intvl;
	END LOOP;
END; 
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
