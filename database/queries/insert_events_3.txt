@param start DATE -- the first date of the recurring event
@param forms_id INTEGER -- the form which these events correspond to
@param intvl INTERVAL -- the interval for which to repeat these events (ex 3 months)

this function creates events for a form scheduled in regular intervals for the next 5 years
